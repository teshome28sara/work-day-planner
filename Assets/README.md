## User Story

```md

 This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

```

✅ When they  scroll down
then they am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

✅ when  they  view the timeblocks for that day
they  each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or futur.e

✅ When they click into a timeblock
then they  can enter an event.

✅ When they  click the save button for that timeblock
then  the text for that event is saved in local storage.
